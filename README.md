This demo allows you to play the drums, by pressing the on-screen buttons, or your keyboard keys!

See the `index.js` for my use of:
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Anonymous functions
- Callback functions
- Event Listeners
- Seperation of concerns with behvaiour and styling, via the `classList` property

Final demo can be played via opening `index.html` from the **main** branch in your web browser.
